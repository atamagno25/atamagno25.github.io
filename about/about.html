        		<h1>About me!</h1>
				<p>I'm a computer science student at San Diego State University with a strong interest in sports and films! </p>
				<p>I'm intersted in data science and its usage in sports.</p>
				<p>Over my time at SDSU I have been part of the AI club, this has helped me develop a passion for machine learning and artificial intlligence. For the past two years, I was the Chief Technical Officer where I was responsible for the training and education for the club. For my final year at SDSU, I will be the president of the club and am excited to see what it holds.</p>
				<p>As a big sports fan I'm always looking for new ways to analyze sports, this has led me to take sports statistics classes that have helped drive my passion. Being a big soccer fan, I am enthralled in the cutting edge of soccer stats and being able to bring stats to soccer.</p>
				<p>Film has always been a big part of my life and am interested in film analysis.</p>
				<p>I love to travel!</p>
