        		<h1>About me!</h1>
				<p>I'm a computer science student at San Diego State University with a strong interest in sports and films! </p>
				
				<p>I'm intersted in data science and its usage in sports.</p>
				<p>Over my time at SDSU I have been part of the AI club, this has helped me develop a passion for machine learning and artificial intlligence. For the past two years, I was the Chief Technical Officer where I was responsible for the training and education for the club. For my final year at SDSU, I will be the president of the club and am excited to see what it holds.</p>
				<p>As a big sports fan I'm always looking for new ways to analyze sports, this has led me to take sports statistics classes that have helped drive my passion. Being a big soccer fan, I am enthralled in the cutting edge of soccer stats and being able to bring stats to soccer.</p>
				<p>Film has always been a big part of my life and am interested in film analysis. Film is my favorite art form and I'm constantly looking for new ways to connect to it be it directing or writing.</p>
				<p>I love to travel! Traveling is a blessing and I love to experice different parts of the world.</p>
