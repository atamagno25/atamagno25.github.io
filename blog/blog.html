      <h2>The Suns rise for Kyrie</h2>
      <h5>A rexamination of the Kyrie Irving trade, June 23, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>In the summer of 2017, following a loss in the NBA finals to the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavs point guard Kyrie Irving made it known that he wanted to be traded. After a summer of discontent, Kyrie would be traded to the Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and the Brooklyn Net's 2018 first-round pick. Three years later only Zizic is still on the roster for either team, cementing the trade as a sort of lose-lose for both teams. Neither team won a championship or was better off after it</p>
      <p>In 2020, this trade looks to have been a failure on all sides. Thomas, Crowder and Zizic had little impact on the Cav's finals aspirations with both Thomas and Crowder being traded later in the season. The Brooklyn Net's pick turned out to be Collin Sexton, who has shown flashes of his potential. However in the next year's draft, the cavs selected another guard forcing Sexton out of his natural postion.</p>
      <p>While the Cetlics no longer have Irving and didn't make a finals, they seem to be in a better position. With Jayson Tatum maturing into a star and Kemba Walker, signed to replace Kyrie, turning the Celtics into a real title contender.</p>
      <p>Looking back at the rumors of that summer, Kyrie had made it clear that the Phoenix Suns were his preferred destination. As the trade fell apart for both teams, would things have gone differently had Kyrie been traded to the Suns? Did the Suns have a better trade package?</p>
