        		<h1>Works and Projects!</h1>
				<p>On my github, I have uploaded all my workshops and projects that I have created over my time at SDSU.</p>
				<p>These workshops have been used by the club as a template for the education that we have provided at the club. The workshops are great for any level of ML expertise and show real world applications. My personal favorite is the NBA moneyball workshop where we looked at the correlation between certain stats and how they affect wins and certain player's contracts.</p>
				<p>Another thing that I'm really passionate about is teaching and working with others. I'm constantly looking to tutor or TA certain classes and materials. Check out the youtube video below to see me work through a physics problem!</p>
